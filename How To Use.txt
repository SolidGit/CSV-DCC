place "CSV DCC" in a folder 
	in the same folder create a .txt file called "CSV Location"
		in that file on the first line write the FROM directory in the format
				Drive:\Dir\Dir\Dir\CSV folder\
			for example:
				E:\Users\HappyUser\Desktop\MyCSVs\
		On the second line in the same format write the output directory 
		
*If the output directory does not exist the script will attempt to make it if permissions don't interefere

Cheers!
